# Written Assessment (45 minutes)

Please provide thorough answers to the following questions. Include code examples where relevant.

## Technical Assessment Questions

### 1. React Server Components (RSC)
a) Explain the key differences between Server Components and Client Components in Next.js. Include specific use cases for each.
b) How do RSCs impact application performance and bundle size?
c) Describe the data fetching pattern you would implement with RSCs.

### 2. State Management & Data Fetching
a) Compare and contrast TanStack Query (formerly React Query) with traditional Redux/Context API state management. When would you choose one over the other?
b) Explain TanStack Query's stale-while-revalidate strategy and its benefits.
c) How would you handle optimistic updates using TanStack Query?

### 3. Component Architecture
a) Describe your approach to building a reusable component library using shadcn/ui.
b) How do you handle component composition and prop drilling in large applications?
c) Explain your strategy for managing component styling and theming across a large application.

### 4. Performance & Productivity
a) What metrics do you consider when optimizing a Next.js application's performance?
b) What tools and practices do you use to improve your daily development workflow?
c) Share an example of a challenging debugging scenario and how your debugging toolkit helped resolve it.
d) What are some common gotchas or pitfalls you've encountered when working with Next.js and React Server Components, and how do you proactively avoid them?

## System Design Scenario

Design a high-level architecture for a real-time dashboard that displays various metrics from multiple data sources. The dashboard needs to:
- Update in real-time
- Handle user authentication
- Be performance optimized
- Support different view permissions
- Be optimized for developer productivity and maintenance

Your design should include:
1. Component structure
2. Data fetching strategy
3. State management approach
4. Performance considerations
5. Error handling strategy

Provide diagrams or pseudo-code where appropriate to illustrate your design decisions.

## Submission Guidelines

1. Write your answers directly in this markdown file
2. Use code blocks for any code examples
3. Include diagrams as ASCII art or links to images
4. Commit your changes to your solution branch
5. Push your changes before starting the coding assessment

## Evaluation Criteria

Your written assessment will be evaluated based on:
- Technical accuracy
- Depth of understanding
- Clarity of communication
- Real-world applicability
- Strategic thinking
- Best practices awareness
